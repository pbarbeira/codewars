# CodeWars

Codewars is a code practice platform that revolves around the concept of "Kata". A kata is a system of individual training exercises used to achieve mastery in marttial arts. It boils down to a sequence of postures that must be practiced daily, until flow is achieved.
 
The concept of "Code Kata" was been around for quite some time. It means coding challenges and exercises that model real world scenarios, and that can - and should - be solved several times. This process allows the programmer to explore different approaches to the solution, as well as compare the different solutions he came up with and assess his evolution. In Codewars, kata are organized by difficulty, from 8-kyu, the simplest kata, usually related to base language features; up to 1-kyu, the hardest kata, usually related to complex algorithmic techniques.

This repository contains my personal journey in Codewars, codified as the different solutions to the different problems. The repository is organized by language, then difficulty. Solutions usually include some form of manual testing.
